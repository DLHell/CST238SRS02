You may choose between one of two possible projects. The first is a coding exercise. The second, an interviewing exercise. 


Option #1

Target Alarm Range  

You've been tasked with creating a mobile UI for an industrial baking oven.  

The app will connect to an oven allowing employees to monitor the oven's state and adjust the oven settings.  

Purpose:  
  - Learn to implement interfield dependencies.  
  - Learn to differentiate between initial and running states.  
  - Learn to handle configuration data.  
  
Specification:  

Create an app that controls an oven's temperature.  

The app will have 3 input temperatures. The minimum, maximum, and target temperature.  The app must also display the current oven temperature.  

If the temperature exceeds the range of inputs, obtain the attention of the user.  

Your app should handle both Farenheit and Celsius values based upon configuration controlled by the user at run-time.  

Ensure valid field and form entry for target using the closed interval range [200, 500]F or [90, 240]C.  

You may use any method of input/output you want for adjusting set points.  Field and form level validation is expected for all fields. Note the fields are not independent because min should never exceed max.   

Consider allowing for multiple input methods.  For example, you may want the user to enter data using an entry field for accurate input and sliders for quick input.  The choice of how to make the input easy, clear, and accurate is a balancing act and part of the design goal.

Option #2  

Interviewing Skills  

Purpose:  

- Learn how to interview the user of an app you are designing.  
- Provide feedback to the user to see if what you are creating meets their needs.  

Often applications are developed in a vacuum. The User Interface designer creates an application they think will be helpful to their target users but finds out after spending months (and sometimes years) they didn't understand the problem or better solution already exists.  

In this SRS your job is to develop an application design so you can practice interviewing potential users before starting the difficult work of creating an application.  

You must select a potential user that you don't know. A good rule of thumb is that if you know their name already, pick someone else.  A friend of a friend is fine.  

Some good sources may be school staff, public official, business owner, etc... For example, TriMet has developer resources and people that you can interview regarding their software services.  

Present the problem and a proposed solution as a mobile application. Develop a set of requirements, wireframes, storyboards, use cases, and any other materials that help you convey the idea to the class.  

Emphasize the problem, why current solutions are inadequate, and why your proposal will improve the current situation.  

Identify the stakeholders and be sure to interview at least one representative from each type of stakeholder category.  For example, if you interview a librarian for a library service, also interview a library patron.  

After you draw up your proposal, review it with the person you interviewed to be sure you captured the entire problem and your solution is adequate.  

Include the contact information of all the people you interviewed.  I will not contact them myself, but keep a record of the people you interviewed should you need to come back to them.  

At a minimum, you must interview someone at least twice.  The first time to understand their needs and the second time to get feedback on your proposed solution.
