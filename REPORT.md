# CST238SRS02
Target Alarm Range

Name: Daniel Lee

Notes: The layout and concept behind this was interesting.

Issues: Lack of control in setting up time for working on this project. Really have to make time to learn as this is a new environment and
new language to work with.


Design:
Downward input movement, Target -> Min -> Max, then a button to submit input
Keep it simple to start, limit possible errors by only allowing number input

Second page displays Current Temp (Figure out how that works) and then error notification if it goes wrong
"OVEN IS OVERHEATING"
"OVEN IS COOLING"

Check on how to make the text larger (forgot how to)


Field/Form Validation is still a mess, check out what Mitch sent and try to contact Silver.
Consider how to dedicate more time to GUI, seems to always not be able to put enough time to assignments

Mitch wants to have a method to convert F to C and vice versa, look up the formula for changing temp.


HOW DO YOU MAKE THE APP CREATE A VIBRATION??
